xish
====

xish is a UNIX shell that is being developed for xilli linux.

The core concept behind xish, is that your shell is just a 
state machine that remembers environment variables, executes
processes, and manages pipes between them.  Given the highly
networked world we live in, xish will also treat sockets as
first class citizens, have built in support for SSL/TLS, as
well as pipes, named-pipes, files, and the usual stdin, stdout,
stderr trifecta.

Unlike nearly all of the shells in existence, xish will not 
have builtin commands.  Instead, xish will provide a socket
interface and messaging protocol by which external programs 
can use to modify the current xish state.  Access to this 
socket will require that all messages be cryptographically
signed.  Binaries executed by xish may also require signing
as well, to make it easier to secure remote access to system
resources.

xish roadmap
------------

* base command interpreter
* evented messaging and socket interface
* off the shelf crypto integration
* suite for minimal sh/bash compatability
* map & reduce pipe operators
* binary signing and command verification
